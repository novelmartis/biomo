Generation of the stimuli towards the testing of a predisposition to biological motion in chicks

This is a matlab code based on Psychtoolbox to generate oscillatory stimuli for testing the predisposition of chicks to selectively attend to periodic, biological motion. The report describing the experiment is available at (https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.2067039)
